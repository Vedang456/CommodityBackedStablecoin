# GoldSilverStablecoin 

**GoldSilverStablecoin** is a Solidity-based stablecoin smart contract backed by a weighted ratio of gold (80%) and silver (20%). The contract uses Chainlink price feeds for real-time gold and silver price data to determine the stablecoin value. This project provides a robust solution for creating a tangible asset-backed cryptocurrency.

## Features  

- **Minting**: Stablecoins can be minted based on the value of gold and silver provided by the owner.  
- **Burning**: Users can burn stablecoins, effectively reducing the total supply.  
- **Real-Time Price Feeds**: The contract integrates Chainlink price feeds to fetch live gold and silver prices.  
- **Ratio-Based Valuation**: Implements an 80:20 ratio for gold-to-silver value calculations.  
- **Access Control**: Only the contract owner can mint stablecoins, ensuring secure management.

## Prerequisites  

### Tools Required  
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) (for development, testing, and deployment)  
- Node.js (for additional package support, if needed)  
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Anvil for local testing)  
- RPC endpoint (e.g., Infura or Alchemy for mainnet/testnet access)  

### Environment Variables  
The project requires the following environment variables to run:  
```bash  
export GOLD_PRICE_FEED=<Chainlink Gold/USD Price Feed Address>  
export SILVER_PRICE_FEED=<Chainlink Silver/USD Price Feed Address>  
export PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Ethereum Private Key>  
```  

- Replace `<Chainlink Gold/USD Price Feed Address>` and `<Chainlink Silver/USD Price Feed Address>` with actual Chainlink addresses for the desired network.  
- Replace `<Your Ethereum Private Key>` with your private key for deployment or interaction.

## Library Imports  

The project relies on the following libraries:  

1. **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: For ERC20 token standard and ownership modules.  
2. **Forge-std**: Foundry's standard library for testing and deployment.  
3. **Chainlink Brownie Contracts**: For accessing Chainlink price feed interfaces.  

### Steps to Install Libraries  

#### 1. OpenZeppelin Contracts  
Run the following command to install OpenZeppelin Contracts into your Foundry project:  
```bash  
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts  
```  

#### 2. Forge-std Library  
Install the standard library for testing and scripting:  
```bash  
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std  
```  

#### 3. Chainlink Brownie Contracts  
Install the Chainlink Brownie contracts:  
```bash  
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts  
```  

#### Update Dependencies  
After installing the libraries, run the following command to fetch and link them in your project:  
```bash  
forge update  
```

## Getting Started  

### Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/Vedang456/GoldSilverStablecoin.git  
cd GoldSilverStablecoin  
```  

### Compile the Contract  
Run the following to compile the smart contract:  
```bash  
forge build  
```  

---

## Deployment  

The deploy script is designed to streamline the deployment process using Foundry.  

### Steps to Deploy  
1. Export the required environment variables:  
   ```bash  
   export GOLD_PRICE_FEED=0x...  # Replace with actual gold price feed address  
   export SILVER_PRICE_FEED=0x...  # Replace with actual silver price feed address  
   export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...  # Replace with your Ethereum private key  
   ```  

2. Run the deployment script:  
   ```bash  
   forge script script/Deploy.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --broadcast --verify --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY  
   ```  
   - Replace `<RPC_URL>` with your Ethereum provider's RPC endpoint (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, or Anvil for local testing).  

3. Verify the deployment:  
   - Check the deployment logs for the deployed contract address.  
   - Confirm on a blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherscan for mainnet/testnet).

## Testing  

### Writing and Running Tests  
This project includes flexibility for users to write and run their own tests using Foundry.  
1. Write test cases in the `test` folder.  
2. Execute the test suite:  
   ```bash  
   forge test  
   ```  

Foundry's testing framework will compile and execute all tests, providing detailed output for any issues.

## Usage  

After deploying the contract, you can interact with it using a web3 client (e.g., Remix, Foundry's `cast`, or a custom dApp).  

Key functions include:  
- **`mint(uint256 goldAmount, uint256 silverAmount)`**: Mints stablecoins based on provided gold and silver amounts. Restricted to the contract owner.  
- **`burn(uint256 amount)`**: Burns stablecoins from the caller's account.  
- **`calculateStablecoinValue(uint256 goldAmount, uint256 silverAmount)`**: Calculates the stablecoin value using gold and silver amounts.
